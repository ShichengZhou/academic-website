About me: I grew up in Ya'an, Sichuan, China, the hometown of pandas and the origin of artificial planting tea of the world. During my past 23 years, I spent most of my lifetimes studying in different cities. Ya'an, Chengdu, Harbin, I studied across from the southwest to the northeast of China. Now I am going to pursue my Ph.D. degree in Tokyo, Japan. Hope everything goes well.
